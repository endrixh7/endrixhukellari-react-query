## Starting the Local Server
    - Open 'Server' folder and run commands:
        - npm install
        - npm start
    - To access server go to 'localhost:5000'
        - You will see 'Hello from server'
    - Make sure to leave the server up and running

## Working on the Client Side 
    - Open 'Starter' folder and run commands:
        - npm i
        - npm run dev (vite configurations)
    - Install React Query (check version , stick with v4 or install v5)
        - npm i @tanstack/react-query
        - import QueryClient, QueryCLientProvider, wrap the 'app' with 'QueryClientProvider'
        - create instance for the Query Client
        - add this prop to our app
        - Done âœ…

## Note
    Important Update !!!
    In the latest version of React Query (V5), the 'isLoading' property has been replaced with 'isPending'. This change is purely in naming; the functionality remains the same, where the property is true if the query has not yet received data. If you are using a different version of React Query than the one provided in the starter package, remember to use 'isPending' instead of 'isLoading'.

## Alternative Server Setup (server configurations)
    - After finishing our app we can store all items on server
    - We used array to store data (we will lose all data)
    - Saving on a local file system
        - local server (nodemon localDataServer)
        - npm run local-server
            - Now go to the Starter and add a Random Task through the UI
        - Stop and Start the server again on the 'Server'
            - Refresh the App and Data will be there
        - Normally this will be saved to the Database (MongoDB)
